# PyPDFScoreSlicer
PyPDFScoreSlicer is a Python tool designed to simplify the management of scanned sheet music PDFs. It automatically extracts the title and instrument or part information from each page, groups pages by musical part, and displays the result to the user. Once verified, the tool suggests filenames and can split the PDF into separate files per instrument or part.
